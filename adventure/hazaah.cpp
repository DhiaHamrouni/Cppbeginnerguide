cout << "Humans : Armed with a superior intelect and hand craft more than any other species on earth , Humans imposed themselves on the planet.They can also access many different paths in life and become basically anything they want to be. They are limited tho in physical abilities and have some what of narrowed vision towards other races and unknown creatures. They are also easily mimicked by species that can disguise efficiently and have highly deceitful such as foxes and aliens making them affect their social statues which is imperative for the humans.\n\nDoggo: This race is highly known for their pride and trustworth. Whether it is in a fight or daily routines , a doggo's faith is unquestionable during 'ruff' times. Even though they have a lower iq than most humans, they excell in detecting scents and defending themselves thanks to their good offensive stats and will power. the good doggos work in helping in need humans or to handle police activites and guarding high value. It is aso noted that humans and doggos have a chemistry between them and usually get along pretty well unlike doggos and cats/foxes \n\nCats: They excell in appearances and fluffiness , cats make for great snuggling partners and casual one night stands if you know what I mean. They have some what of a fiery relationship with dogs but whenraised together , dogs and cats get along well so don't be suprised if you see a dog and a cat as a couple. Cats get along pretty well with humans. They tend to be more agressive when provoked or when they are in a bad mood even with their companions. Their appearances make for great social scores which advantages then in certain domains such as modeling and managing sales.\n\nAliens: As the name suggests , these creatures are not originally from earth.Their existance within the earth is kind of Hush Hush so it's best not to reveal that you're not an alien or else you will be probably followed around by authorities. They have somewhat of a superiority complex since they are the only species to have a higher intellect than the humans so they are not very accpeted in social gatherings. They excel in scientific fields and innovations but have low social interaction with other species stats but they communicate better with other aliens. As stated before , Aliens have the capacity to disguise themselves as other entities so they can be pretty hard to detect unless you are faced with a paranoid humans and doggos with high scent stats then you are at risk.\n\nFoxes: Foxes are the embodiment of the syaing 'looks can be deceiving', they have great wit and sleight of hand so they make a living off other people the easy way. The main problem is that this life is kinda hard and makes them a permanent target of authorities especially since they have their eternal enemy doggos working that part of the world.\n";
